// Different types of time complexities


//1 constant time complexity - O(1)

        // this complexity is not dependent on input size and the runtime will always be the same

//2. linear time complexity - O(n)

        // for this complexity, runtime will be directly proportional to length of the input

//3. logarithmic time complexity - O( log n)

        // an algorithm has logarithmic time complexity when;
        // it reduces size of the input data in each step
        // i.e number of operations decrease as input size decrease

//4. quadratic time complexity - O( n ** 2)

        // has non-linear time complexity where the run-time increases non-linearly (O(N**2)) with length of output
        // nested loops take this order

//5. cubic time complexity - O( n ** 3)




// SEARCH ALGORITHMS

//LINEAR SEARCH =       best case O(1)                            worst case        O(n) 


//BINARY SEARCH =       best case O(1)                            worst case        O(log n)


// SORTING ALGORITHMS

// INSERTION SORT =      best case O(n)                            worst case        O(n ** 2) 

// MERGE SORT     =      best case O(n log n)                      worst case        O(n log n) 

// BUBBLE SORT    =      best case O(n)                            worst case        O(n ** 2) 

// QUICK SORT     =      best case O(n log n)                      worst case        O(n ** 2) 



// NB. QUICK SORT - is the best due to its performance and because it is the fastest of all the sorting algorithms
