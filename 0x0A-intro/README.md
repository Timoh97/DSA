## LINEAR DATA STRUCTURE
A linear data structure is one where data items are arranged in a linear fashion. Each member is attached to its neighboring elements. The structure permits single-level data storage because the data elements are stored in a linear fashion. The data can be traversed in one run.

A linear data structure is one where data items are ordered either sequentially or in a linear fashion, and each member is attached to its neighboring elements. The linear data structure's elements can all be accessed in one run. There are four primary types of linear data structures: Queue, Linked Lists,vector, Stack, and Arrays
#### dynamic DSA
1. [Vector]()
2. [Linkedlist]()
3. [Stack]()
4. [Queue]()

#### static DSA 
1. [Arrays]()


## NON-LINEAR DATA STRUCTURE

A non-linear data structure is another important type in which data elements are not arranged sequentially; mainly, data elements are arranged in random order without forming a linear structure. Data elements are present at the multilevel, for example, tree
