//A dynamic data structure has a dynamic size, 
//that is, its size can grow and shrink based on the elements present in it at runtime. 
//It makes efficient use of memory by using only that amount of space in memory that is required at any time. 
//Dynamic memory allocation can be done in both the stack and the heap
